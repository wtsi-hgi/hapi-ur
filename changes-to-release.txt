bug fix: issue with likelihoods of merged diploid states:
  - always have two phase possibilities for a state in a given window that is
    heterozygous (incuding when the previous state is homozygous)
  - should not double the probability of heterozygous states except at the
    first window
--print_trio_kids option for printing the trio children's haplotypes
option to omit family id when reading PLINK .fam files
--force option to be able to overwrite existing output files
print phase type for all samples to log after all phasing results generated
quasi-bug fix: no longer ignore existing parental relationship if one parent
  does not exist in the dataset but one does (i.e., treat as duo)
print error and quit if two individuals have the same id
