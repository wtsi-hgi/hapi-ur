    * Support for PLINK BED genotype input data

    * Support for phased results in IMPUTE2 format

    * Trio/duo individuals can only be included using PLINK BED input data

    * Offset for the first iteration is random, not always 0

    * vote-phase:
    genotype file is no longer needed on input
    support for IMPUTE2 format phased input

    * Bug fix: don't increase the window size beyond the total number of
    markers included; cap at 1/2 the total number of markers

    * Minor bug fix for calculating recombination probability: must subtract
    the number of duos from 2 * number of samples to get the true number of
    haplotypes (duos have one identical haplotype)

    * Minor bug fix to random initialization: initialize trio parents
    together to ensure their haplotypes are consistent with the trio child's
    genotypes.  (Otherwise the first iteration can crash.)
